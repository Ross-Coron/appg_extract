Script to extract All-Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) information. For each APPG listed in Parliament's [Register of All-Party Parliamentary Groups](https://www.parliament.uk/mps-lords-and-offices/standards-and-financial-interests/parliamentary-commissioner-for-standards/registers-of-interests/register-of-all-party-party-parliamentary-groups/) (saved locally but could be scraped), extracts information (stored as tables) into a nested list. Script utilises the [18 June 2025 Register](https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm/cmallparty/250618/contents.htm) which contains information on 514 individual Groups. 

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

library(dplyr)
library(readr)
library(rvest)
library(stringr)
library(purrr)

```


Load in APPG webpages (saved locally).

```{r}

# Get files
files <- list.files(path="./appg_webpages", full.names=TRUE, recursive=FALSE)

# Filter out non-HTML files
files <- files[!grepl("\\.txt$", files)]

# Get APPG names
appg_names <- str_extract(files, "(?<=2025ï¼š).*?(?=\\(29_06)") |>
   str_trim()

# Read HTML code as string
html_vector <- lapply(files, read_file)

```


Populate tibble with APPG names and corresponding webpage's HTML code.

```{r}

# Populate dataframe with APPG names and HTML code
raw_appg_df <- tibble(
   name = appg_names,
   html_code = html_vector
)

# Preview HTML code (500 chars)
substr(raw_appg_df$html_code[[1]], 1, 500)

```


Demo: reconstruct webpage from HTML string.

```{r}

tmp_file <- tempfile(fileext = ".html")

writeLines(html_vector[[1]], tmp_file)

# Open in browser
browseURL(tmp_file)

```


Demo: read in APPG's HTML code and extract tables.

```{r}

test_page <- raw_appg_df$html_code[[1]] %>% 
   read_html()

page_tables <- html_table(test_page)
page_tables

```


Main script: extracts APPG information into a nested list. Reads in HTML code corresponding to an APPG's webpage from a dataframe, extracts tables, and plucks values.

```{r}

appg <- list()

   # Parse HTML and extract tables

      read_html() %>% 
      html_table()
   
   # Extract table values
