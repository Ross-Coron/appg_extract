# Extracting APPG Information

### About APPGs 

All-Party Parliamentary Groups (APPGs) are informal cross-party groups within Parliament (UK). APPGs exist to examine particular topics or causes such as small modular reactors, blood cancer, and Saudi Arabia. While APPGs can provide useful forums for bringing together stakeholders and advancing policy discussions, there have been instances of impropriety, and the groups have faced criticisms for potential conflicts of interest and undue influence from external bodies.

At at 18 June 2025, there were ~500 individual APPGs. Active APPGs are listed in Parliament's [Register of All-Party Parliamentary Groups](https://www.parliament.uk/mps-lords-and-offices/standards-and-financial-interests/parliamentary-commissioner-for-standards/registers-of-interests/register-of-all-party-party-parliamentary-groups/). The register is updated every ~6 weeks and contains information on the APPG's purpose, Parliamentarians, contact details, annual general meeting, and registrable benefits. The current Rules for APPGs were agreed by the House of Commons, on [19 July 2023](https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2023-07-19/debates/110BBCAB-684E-447C-9995-7DEA813D8D3F/All-PartyParliamentaryGroups). APPGs are overseen by the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards and the Committee on Standards.
